# 🧾 Salary Scale Generator – Shell Script
This repository contains a shell script created for a university project. The script generates salary scale tables for a hypothetical employee based on user input.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This was a **research and scripting project** for a Computer Architecture and Convergence (CATC) module. The goal was to build a simple interactive shell script that:

- Accepts a **starting salary**
- Asks for the **number of points** on the salary scale
- Accepts the **annual increment value**
- Asks whether the employee is a **manager** (who receives two increments per year)

Based on this data, the script then calculates and displays:
- A salary progression table over time
- The **yearly salary at each point**, starting from the current year

## 🚀 How to Run the Script

> 🐧 This script is designed to be run on **Linux/macOS** systems in a Bash shell.

### 1. Open a terminal
### 2. Clone this repository (or download the script directly)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Peter-8312/PeterCarrollCATCProject.git
cd PeterCarrollCATCProject
```

### 3. Make the file excutable:
```bash
chmod +x salary-scale.sh
```
### 4. Run the script
```bash
./salary-scale.sh
```
The script will prompt you for:
- Starting salary
- Number of points on the salary scale
- Increment amount
- Whether the employee is a manager
- It will then display a table showing the salary progression by year.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
This project was designed to assess and demonstrate:
- Proficiency with **shell scripting**
- Proper use of **loops and conditional logic**
- Ability to research and solve problems independently
- Use of the **Vim editor** to create and edit scripts
